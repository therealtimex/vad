# Silero V5

Note: This fork focuses on Silero v6 only. For legacy v5 notes, refer to upstream docs. You can try the current v6 test site at [therealtimex.github.io/vad/test-site](https://therealtimex.github.io/vad/test-site/).

The frame size is automatically set based on the model: 512 samples for the "v5" model and 1536 samples for the "legacy" model. You no longer need to configure `frameSamples` manually.
