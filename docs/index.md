# Welcome

This is the documentation for [therealtimex/vad](https://github.com/therealtimex/vad), a JavaScript package for voice activity detection. VAD lets you prompt your user for microphone permissions and run callbacks on segments of audio with user speech in a few lines of code.

Be aware that this documentation may not always be up-to-date. You can always supplement it by checking the [examples](https://github.com/therealtimex/vad/tree/master/examples) and [source code](https://github.com/therealtimex/vad/tree/master/packages), or the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/therealtimex/vad/issues).

When browsing this site on GitHub Pages, you can try the interactive Test Site at [/test-site/](./test-site/).
